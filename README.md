# rps-weapons
Weapon classes for RPS which implement '#vs' to allow for readable battles

Commonly, RPS implementations use a hash or array to determine the result of a battle.  I wanted to remove these primatives and use a common interface on three classes of weapon.  Here, '#vs' is implemented by all three weapons.  The classes are super easy to read / extend / modify.
